# Import external code that we will be using to perform our basic calculations
#these are various libraries to be able to import into our project area
# able to use with csv files and spreadsheets that are file on my computer to import them into python
import pandas as pd
#this will allow us to run statistics on the imported data
import statistics
# this will be ran to be able to calculated addition,etc 
import numpy as np

# Import data from an external website
df = pd.read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bradmessner/SDT500-Business-Analytics/main/MELBOURNE_HOUSE_PRICES_LESS.csv")
df.info()           # outputs the basic info about my data

# Drop any values where the Price column is empty
#taking any values that are empty in the imported data set and getting rid of them for further calculations
df = df.dropna(subset=['Price'])
myData = df['Price'].tolist()

# Output a header and then calculate basic statistics
# means a new line is created
print("\n\n")
#what type of statistics is being performed on the data set
print("Descriptive Statistics")
#to create a line before all the calculations of the data set
print("======================")
# able to calculate the count of how many there are in the data set
print("Count is:  ", len(myData))
#able to calculate the mean of the data set
print("Mean is:   ", statistics.mean(myData))
# able to calculate the median of the data set imported
print("Median is: ", statistics.median(myData))
#able to calculate the mode of the date set
print("Mode is:   ", statistics.mode(myData))
#able to calculate the minimum value of the data set
print("Min is:    ", min(myData))
#able to calculate the maximum value of the data set
print("Max is:    ", max(myData))
#able to calculate the range of the data set
print("Range is:  ", max(myData)-min(myData))
#able to calculate the standard deviation of the data set
print("St Dev is: ", statistics.stdev(myData))
#able to calculate the variance of the data set
print("Variance:  ", statistics.variance(myData))
#able to calculate the lower quartile of the data set
print("Lower Q:   ", np.percentile(myData, 25))
#able to calculate the upper quartile of the data set
print("Upper Q:   ", np.percentile(myData, 75))
#able to calculate the interquartle range of the data set 
print("Inter Q R: ", np.percentile(myData, 75) - np.percentile(myData, 25))# Main file of the Python 3 program.
